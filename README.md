# MTerminal
MTerminal is a terminal-based app made in Python. I made MTerminal to test my skills and give myself a challenge. MTerminal is still in the very early stages of development. It is going to be a Terminal for a system kind-of like a high-level mini operating system. It will have a file that contains all the programs and files the terminal can access.
